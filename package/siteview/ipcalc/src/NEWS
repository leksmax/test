* Version 0.2.5 (unreleased)
- Fixed compilation with no geoinformation
- Fixed segmentation faul when compiled with, but run without libmaxminddb.


* Version 0.2.4 (released 2018-07-23)
- Added support for libmaxmind DB API as an alternative to libgeoip.


* Version 0.2.3 (released 2018-05-26)
- Fixed --no-decorate option with --split and IPv6 addresses.
- Fixed build with USE_GEOIP=yes and USE_DYN_GEOIP=no (David Guglielmi)
- Fixed build with libgeoip < 1.6.3


* Version 0.2.2 (released 2017-12-27)
- Added a more silent version of --split when combined with
  --no-decorate option.


* Version 0.2.0 (released 2017-05-15)
- Added the --split (-S) option. This allows splitting networks
  into smaller chunks.


* Version 0.1.8 (released 2016-06-14)
- Do not print the reverse DNS information by default. Only
  when --all-info is specified.


* Version 0.1.7 (released 2016-04-01)
- Assume a classless IPv4 range by default. This breaks compatibility
  with previous versions since, unless --class-prefix is specified,
  the default IPv4 prefix is now /32.
- Added support for printing reverse DNS addresses.


* Version 0.1.6 (released 2015-12-08)
- Introduced color printing.


* Version 0.1.5 (released 2015-11-05)
- Auto-detect IPv6 addresses when generating random networks.
- Removed libpopt dependency by using getopt_long().


* Version 0.1.4 (released 2015-10-14)
- Added the --all-info option to enable the printing of all
  available information.


* Version 0.1.3 (released 2015-10-05)
- Print the country code in informational mode.


* Version 0.1.2 (released 2015-06-09)
- Print the country code when --geoinfo is requested.
- Only quote the strings if there are spaces in them.


* Version 0.1.1 (released 2015-05-19)
- Allow a prefix of 0, or 0.0.0.0 to be compatible with previous
  tool.


* Version 0.1.0 (released 2015-05-18)
- Added --random-private parameter to generate private networks.
- IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are now automatically being detected,
  and the --ipv4 or --ipv6 options are not mandatory to specify.
- Added the --minaddr and --maxaddr options to print the minimum
  and maximum addresses in the provided network.
- Added the --addresses option to print the number of addresses
  in the provided network.
- Added the --addrspace option to print the type of the network
  the address resides on.
- Added the --geoinfo option to print geographic information about
  the given IP address. That will work if libGeoIP is found on
  the system.
- By default, when no parameters are given, general information
  about the provided network/address are printed (also as --info
  option).
